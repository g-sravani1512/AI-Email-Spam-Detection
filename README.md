📧 AI Email Spam Detection System

A modern AI-powered email spam detection web application that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using a machine learning backend and a stylish JavaScript-based frontend.

This project demonstrates real-world frontend–backend integration, clean UI/UX design, and practical use of AI in web applications.

How It Works:


1. User enters email content in the UI

2. JavaScript validates input and sends data to backend using fetch()

3. Flask API receives the email text

4. Backend analyzes the content using spam keywords logic

5. API returns prediction ( Spam / Not Spam)

6. Frontend dynamically updates the UI with color-coded result
